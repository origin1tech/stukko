#Assets
----

Assets are just that, assets that make your application do all the cool stuff it does. See individual folders for more
detailed README.

Assets folder contains sub directories which are explained below:

**framework** - stores your client side framework such as Angular, Backbone or Ember.

**minify** - all css/js files saved in this location will be minified and saved to their respective /public folders.

**mixin** - css/js files are concatenated into a single file called mixins.js and mixins.css respectively.

**preprocess** - here is where you'll store your .less or .sass files for pre-processing and compiling to css.
